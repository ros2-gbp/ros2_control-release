  * Fix update rate issues by working around MutliThreadedExecutor (#275 <https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/issues/275>)
    * Fix update rate issues by working around MutliThreadedExecutor
    Currently the MutliThreadedExecutor performance is very bad. This leads
    to controllers not meeting their update rate. This PR is a temporary
    workaround for these issues.
    The current approach uses a rclcpp timer to execute the control loop.
    When used in combination with the MutliThreadedExecutor, the timers
    are not execute at their target frequency. I've converted the control
    loop to a while loop on a separate thread that uses nanosleep to
    execute the correct update rate. This means that rclcpp is not
    involved in the execution and leads to much better performance.
